# Typing Test

This is a project I started in order to learn React and to improve my typing.
It is a work in progress and not meant to be used in production.

I use the app on a daily basis but there are still many shortcomings if it were meant to be used by a broader audience. Some of these are:

* currently only tested for Firefox on Windows
* only tested for a german Windows keyboard
* some of the keys (WinL, WinR, PrtSc, ScLk) need to be remapped with OS tools, so that they can be typed. There is no documentation on how to do that yet.  
* API error handling is missing
* Menu is missing
* UI is only english 
* UI is not yet intuitive
*...

I will continue to work on the Project and will address these shortcomings one by one.
The backend code for this app will be soon publicly available too.


## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
